What is Androiv

= Introduction =

As the word suggest, it is a mix between Android & UAV. The target of this project is to create a framework that make use of Android as a UAV platform.

= Details =

 Android mobiles are getting lighter, faster and full of sensors, similar boards will be too hard to build with the same amount of processing power and sensors while keeping the weight that low. Around internet you can find similar project integrating Arduino with Android. However we go for a more direct solution, using IOIO a special board design to support I/O ports for Android. IOIO are programmed high level using Java, no complexities and a minimum knowledge of hardware is required to use it.
